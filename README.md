# ðŸ”§ AuthTask API â€“ TypeScript Backend

A clean and scalable **TypeScript-based Express.js backend** featuring:

- JWT authentication with refresh token logic  
- Full CRUD operations for **users** and **tasks**  
- Secure password hashing with `secure-password`  
- Input sanitization using `sanitize-html`  
- Data validation via `zod`  
- MongoDB integration via Mongoose  
- Modular controller + middleware structure  
- Ideal for learning or kickstarting real-world projects


## ðŸš€ Features
